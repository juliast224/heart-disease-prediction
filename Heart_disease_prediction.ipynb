    "Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection can be critical for successful treatment. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting the risk of heart disease by analyzing various features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and smoking habits. In this notebook, we will explore a heart disease dataset and build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient features."

    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest causes of death is heart disease. The World Health Organization estimates that 17.9 million people worldwide per year die because of cardiovascular disorders (CVD), such as heart disease. By 2030, the WHO expects that there will be 23.6 million fatalities caused by CVD worldwide, with heart disease and stroke being the main contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cardiovascular disease is any condition affecting the heart and blood vessels. A cardiovascular problem affects the main blood vessels that supply the heart muscles. These blood channels develop plaque, which is made up of cholesterol deposits, that restricts blood flow to the heart and other vital organs. If undetected, this can eventually result in a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure. Heart conditions are regarded as silent killers and sometimes aren't discovered until they start to cause life threatening symptoms. Detecting a heart disease is complex and takes many different methods (also in combination) for diagnosis: a variety of blood tests, MRIs and CT scans, ECGs, or Holter monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is not only the huge amount of fatalities caused by this diseases. Additionally, heart disease places a heavy financial cost on society. The estimated global economic cost of cardiovascular diseases between 2010 and 2015 was USD 3.7 trillion. Employees with cardiovascular disease were responsible for 25–35% of a company's annual medical costs. To reduce the financial and physical costs of heart disease for individuals, organizations, and society as a whole, early detection is crucial. It is feasible to develop models that could assist in predicting the probability of who is most likely to suffer from heart disease by utilizing Machine Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is already important in the field of medicine. It is being utilized for the purposes of diagnosis, detection, and prediction of various diseases. In recent times there has been an increased focus on the use of machine learning techniques to determine the likelihood of developing specific illnesses. Numerous recent studies have been conducted on the topic of developing applications of techniques for predicting diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only medical information technology is developing. Also, different types of medical data are advancing and support the use of machine learning techniques. Big data in medicine is frequently utilized to raise the standard of healthcare. These data consist of audio files, laboratory results, earlier diagnosis reports, clinical notes, research, and visuals.\n",
    "In recent years, the field of machine learning in the healthcare industry has been improved significantly. These methods have gained widespread acceptance and have proven effective in a variety of healthcare settings, particularly in the area of medical cardiology. The quick accumulation of medical data has given researchers an unexpected chance to create and evaluate new algorithms in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following are a few relevant business context examples where using machine learning can be extremely beneficial:\n",
    "- **Healthcare providers** can use this data to create individualized prevention and treatment strategies for people who are at risk, which over time can improve health outcomes and save costs.\n",
    "- **Insurance companies** can use this information to assess and manage risk, which will allow them to establish reasonable premiums and prevent needless pay-outs.\n",
    "- **Public health organizations** can use this information to create targeted education and awareness campaigns that will assist people become more aware of the dangers connected with heart disease and motivate them to take precautions to lower their risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help predicting the likelihood of developing a heart disease will not only support reducing global fatalities caused by CVD but also support the healthcare industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "However, there are some limitations while working with data regarding heart disease, that have to be addressed. \n",
    "The fact that the data scientists using the algorithm do not have sufficient medical understanding is one factor contributing to a high failure rate of data science applications in healthcare. There is not sufficient domain knowledge to fully understand the data, which is why the people developing the machine learning model ideally work closely together with doctors and cardiologists. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this is that it can be observed that quite often there is insufficient data for each patient in a medical dataset, with only one data point listed for each feature. The main issue is that variables like blood pressure, cholesterol, and pulse are not constant. A person's heartbeat and blood pressure change throughout the day and hour. For a patient, it is ideal to have several measurements for each aspect.\n",
    "By developing a machine learning algorithm in this context, it is important to underline, that this will be seen as an approach to help identify patients who are more likely to develop a heart disease. It will not replace a proper diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "The objective of the project is to understand how Machine Learning algorithms can be used to support in predicting if a patient has a higher probability of getting a heart disease by building an optimized model that can be used to predict heart diseases.\n",

    "# About the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes each year the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is the nation’s premier system of health-related telephone surveys. It collects data about US residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "With technical and methodological assistance from CDC, state health departments use in-house interviewers or contract with telephone call centers or universities to administer the BRFSS surveys continuously through the year. The states use a standardized core questionnaire, optional modules, and state-added questions. The survey is conducted using Random Digit Dialing (RDD) techniques on both landlines and cell phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project we used the 2015 survey data. \n",

    "## Handling missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the heatmap it can be seen that we have in some columns a lot of missing data entries. Especially the TOLDHI2 (High blood cholesterol), _BMI5 (BMI), and the FLUSHOT6 (have received flu shot) columns have a lot of missing values.\n",
    "We have thought about the following strategies to deal with the missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delete rows or columns:** This is the simplest approach, where you simply remove any rows or columns that contain missing values. However, this approach can lead to loss of valuable information, especially if a large proportion of the data is missing.\n",
    "- **Imputation:** This approach involves filling in the missing values with estimated values. One common method is mean imputation, where the missing values are replaced with the mean value of the feature. Another method is median imputation, where the missing values are replaced with the median value of the feature. There are also more advanced imputation techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation and regression imputation, which take into account the relationships between different features.\n",
    "- **Model-based imputation:** This approach involves building a predictive model to estimate the missing values based on the values of other features in the dataset. This can be more accurate than simple imputation methods, but requires more computational resources.\n",
    "- **Flagging:** This approach involves adding a new binary feature that indicates whether a value is missing or not. This can be useful if the missing values are informative in themselves.\n",
    "- **Domain knowledge:** In some cases, missing values can be explained by the nature of the problem or the data collection process. In these cases, domain knowledge can be used to impute or flag missing values in a more meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As these values are mostly binary values (either yes or no) it is difficult to replace missing values with estimated values. Furthermore, the missing values do not have any meaning the reason is just that the questions was probably not asked in a certain state. However, the amount of missing values is a lot and because it is just caused by very few columns, that not even have a high correlation with the target variable, we decided to delete the whole columns.

    "**Implications of an unbalanced dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "An unbalanced dataset refers to a situation where the distribution of classes in the dataset is not equal or nearly equal. The dataset at hand is unbalanced, as it contains significantly more cases with people without a heart disease: the target-variable ‘HeartDiseaseorAttack‘ contains 229.787 entries without (0) and only 23.893 people with a heart disease (1). \n",
    "\n",
    "This causes several challenges:\n",
    "1.\t**Bias:** The model may be biased towards the majority class. This is because the model is optimized to minimize the overall error rate, which means it will focus more on the majority class (people without heart disease) at the expense of the minority class (people with heart disease).\n",
    "2.\t**Poor generalization:** The model may not generalize well to new data. This is because the model has not learned enough about the minority class (people with heart disease) to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "3.\t**Scoring metrics:** Some scoring metrics may not be a good choice for evaluating the classification of the unbalanced dataset. For example, precision can be high even when a model performs poorly on the minority class. This is because precision only takes into account the positive predictions made by the model, regardless of whether they belong to the majority or minority class. Additionally, accuracy is not a reliable metric to evaluate the performance of a classifier on unbalanced datasets. For example, a classifier that always predicts ‘no heart disease’ would have a high accurary but fail to identify the minority class. \n",
    "\n",
    "We address these issues the following way:\n",
    "1.\tWe use the scoring metric recall because it takes into account the performance of the model on the minority class and because is particularly useful when the minority class (people with heart disease) is of greater importance than the majority class, as it reflects the ability of the model to correctly identify positive examples, regardless of their frequency. However, recall alone may not be sufficient to evaluate the performance of a model on an unbalanced dataset. The recall might be very low because the model is biased towards the majority class. Thus, we will also use the F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) as it is also a frequently used metric to evaluate models trained on unbalanced datasets to provide a more complete evaluation of the model’s performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tWe will use class weighting to rebalance the dataset to give more importance to the minority class (people with heart disease) in the dataset set. The goal of the class weighting is to improve the performance of the model on the minority class for people with a heart disease. \n"

    "Accuracy measures the number of correct predictions made by the model compared to all predictions. However, the high accuracy score can be misleading in imbalanced datasets where one class is much more frequent than the others. This is the case in this dataset (229,787 no heart-disease, 23,893 heart-disease). If the model would always predict the majority class (no heart-disease) can have a high accuracy but still fail to capture the minority class (heart-disease).\n",

    "\n",
    "AUC is a metric suited for imbalanced datasets. AUC measures the overall performance of a binary classifier by computing the area under the ROC curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different classification thresholds. A high AUC score indicates that the classifier is able to distinguish between the positive and negative classes effectively, regardless of the class distribution. This makes the AUC an important mectric in this case. Measuring the AUC, the model is performing very badly. It has a AUC score of 0.5, which is the same as it would be randomly guessing."
